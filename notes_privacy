providing the individual with the option to give and withdraw consent and to provide the

 ensure no unauthorized access can take place 

 Tactics such as logging of modifications on data and auditing of reports are usually attributed
to accountability tactics, but can also contribute to discovering whether unauthorized
accesses have occurred

Tactics that mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, such as unlinkability and data minimalization.
When unlinkability is practiced, the
link between two items of interest (individuals, messages, data about the individual) is removed, meaning that it is more difficult to determine the connection between these items of interest in case of unauthorized access [46]. When less data is known about an identified individual in unauthorized access, the impact of the privacy violation is also mitigated. When unlinkability is practiced to such an extent that the individual cannot be identified in the
breach, the privacy violation remains a ‘mere’ unauthorized access instead of a privacy violation. It can thus be argued that anonymization and pseudonymization are ways of achieving unlinkability

 ensure that any access to data is done with consent of the individual. For example by asking for consent to place cookies on the individuals
